# LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Keras
Developed a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Keras for sentiment analysis on textual data. Preprocessed and cleaned text data by removing neutral sentiments, tokenization, and sequence padding. Built an embedding layer and an LSTM network to classify text into positive and negative sentiments. Achieved effective model performance with accuracy metrics demonstrating the model's predictive capability.

Concepts used:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence preprocessing.

Deep Learning: Implemented LSTM networks and embedding layers using Keras.

Data Preprocessing: Managed data filtering, class conversion, and handled class imbalance.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, and performed predictions on new data.

Programming Languages & Tools: Python, Keras, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn.
